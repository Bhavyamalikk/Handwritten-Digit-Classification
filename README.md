# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
 DESCRIPTION:
 The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.
 It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
 
 
 TASK:
 The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
 
 
 OUTLINE:
 On the given dataset, the following has been done:
 1. Splitting the data into train and test.
 2. Feature Scaling and Flattening.
 3. Building a sequencial ANN model.
 4. Creating a confusion matrix.
 5. Making of a heatmap to check for the correctly predicted values.
 6. Adding more hidden layers to improve the accuracy.
