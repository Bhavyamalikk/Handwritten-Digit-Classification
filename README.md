# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
 ### DESCRIPTION:
 The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.
 It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
 
 
 ### TASK:
 The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
 
 
 ### OUTLINE:
 On the given dataset, the following has been done:
 1. Importing the libraries.
 2. Loading the data.
 3. Splitting the data into train and test.
 4. Feature Scaling and Flattening.
 5. Building a sequencial ANN model.
 6. Creating a confusion matrix.
 7. Making of a heatmap to check for the correctly predicted values.
 8. Adding more hidden layers to improve the accuracy.
 
 
### END RESULTS:
1. Accuracy and loss after implementing simple neural network: 0.9249, 0.2669
2. Accuracy and loss after adding one more hidden layer : 0.9768, 0.1098
3. Accuracy and loss after adding the 2nd hidden layer : 0.9767, 0.1132
